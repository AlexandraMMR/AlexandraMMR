## Hi, I am Alex

### I :heart: :unicorn: and :dog: but also making things and experiences that delight!

## About me

I am a software engineer and design enthusiast and professional. That is only part of my role, I am also a communities of practice manager and public cloud product person. I work with data, design and mostly develop in Groovy or Java although I also spend a lot of time building websites and tools to automate or improve my team's processes. Currently enrolled in a part-time MSc Computer Science at University of Bath.

My passion for computer science started with my mom, when I was a little girl and I visited her workplace where she used to code in FoxPro while she worked for a car manufacturing company. FoxPro was a very old text-based procedurally oriented programming language and database management system but it fascinated me how she could talk to computers and she began teaching me about talking to machines by writing code on a typewriter, the beauty of the computer was that she also had Kong installed and that made me curious about creating games from code.
